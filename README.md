User Stories


As a user:

    I can add bookmarks to my bookmark list. Bookmarks contain:
        title
        url link
        description
        rating (1-5)
    
    I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app

    All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating

    I can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view

    Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link

    I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list

    I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark

    I can select from a dropdown a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection

    I can edit the rating and description of a bookmark in my list
